# instagram_clone
This project is a mini Instagram-like application built as part of an assignment to demonstrate backend and frontend development skills.
The application allows users to register, log in, create posts, like and comment on posts, follow other users, and view a personalized feed.

The backend is implemented using Django REST Framework, while the frontend is built using React.
Firebase Firestore is used as the database for storing users, posts, likes, comments, and follow relationships.
